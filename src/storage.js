        "If you're forgoing the usual Thanksgiving celebrations this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic but still want something to do remotely with your family and friends, look no further than Among Us, a massively popular free multiplayer mobile game that's way more fun than navigating political talk at the dinner table.\n\nIf you've spent any time on Twitter or around a person under age 30, you've probably become familiar with memes involving colorful Teletubby-like figures clad in spacesuits. These are the players of Among Us, which skyrocketed in popularity over the past few months. \n\nWhat exactly is this game? Why is it so popular all of a sudden? What does US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (perhaps better known as AOC) have to do with all of this? \n\nWe've got everything you need to know about Among Us right here to get you ready for some holiday weekend games.\nWhat is Among Us, and how do you play? \nAmong Us is an online multiplayer social deduction game from developer InnerSloth, similar to Mafia or Werewolf. You can play with four to 10 people -- either people you know, or online with strangers. \n\nIn the game, you play as a crew member aboard a spaceship, sky headquarters or planet base, attempting to keep your ship together and return back to Earth. But one crew member has been replaced by a parasitic shape-shifting alien who wants to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. Problem is, the imposter looks just like everyone else, and will sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, deceive fellow players and try to frame others, all in an attempt to remain undetected and kill off the rest of the crew. (If you have more players, you can choose to have more than one imposter, too. Here's a guide to be the best imposter you can be.)\n\nMeanwhile, the non-alien crew members must perform tasks to fix up the ship, and can't talk unless a death is reported. Then, the surviving crew can openly debate through chat who they think the imposter is, and make their best guess for who to vote off the ship. If the imposter is voted off, the crew wins. But if the group accidentally votes off a crew member, everyone goes back to maintaining the ship until another body is found, and they vote again. \n\nWhy is Among Us so popular all of a sudden? \nAmong Us was released in June 2018, but has suddenly shot to the top of Steam and app download lists, reaching more than 86 million downloads by mid-September. Why the sudden boost in popularity?\nThe answer seems to be Twitch streamers, as popular personalities on the online game streaming platform like Sodapoppin, Pewdiepie, Shroud and Ninja have all played. On Twitch, Among Us has 3.3 million followers -- in comparison, Fortnite has 3.7 million. \n\nTons of Among Us memes have also popped up on Twitter and Reddit, spreading the word about the game further. It's also possible that many people have already exhausted other distance-friendly online games with friends during coronavirus quarantines, and this is something new and easy to play from afar. Plus, the game supports cross-platform play on PC and mobile in both local and online multiplayer games, making it easier for people to play together no matter what device they're on. Many players also use the platform Discord to chat with friends in real time as they play. \n\nOn Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez streamed Among Us on Twitch alongside streamers Pokimane and Hasanabi, in an effort to inspire people to vote. The stream peaked at 439,000 views, making it the third-highest-viewed single stream in Twitch history. (The all-time record is Ninja's, when he teamed up with Drake and Travis Scott in a game of Fortnite.) Viewership ranged from 300,000 to 400,000 for most of the stream.",

        'Quarantine has turned many of us into #Gamers. \n\nYou may recall the Animal Crossing frenzy that took place at the start of the pandemic. The highly anticipated Nintendo Switch game was released just as we found ourselves stuck at home due to COVID-19, with nothing better to do than spend immeasurable amounts of time building virtual islands and talking with anthropomorphic animals.\n\nNow there’s a new game taking over the web, which you may have heard your children, friends or even Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about. It’s called Among Us, and it’s about to be everywhere.\n\nThe game is currently at the top of the App Store and Google Play charts, and according to The Verge, passed 100 million downloads in Q3 2020. Discord — the online service many gamers use to communicate — saw a “new lifetime high for mobile app downloads” since Among Us gained popularity, as many players are using the service to chat about the game. Meanwhile fans of the popular live-streaming service Twitch “have watched more than 200 million hours worth of Among Us gameplay,” according to the New York Times.\n\nDeveloped by indie gaming company InnerSloth back in 2018, Among Us is a multiplayer “social deduction game” you can download and play for free on iOS and Android devices, or on your PC for $4.99. \n\nThe gameplay is quite simple and echoes classic deduction party games like Mafia or Werewolf that require you to read behavior and determine who’s lying and who’s telling the truth. \n\nAt the start of each game — which you can play with as few as four and as many as 10 people — you are secretly given the role of either “crewmember” or “the imposter.” If you’re a crewmember, your job is to run around the spaceship completing tasks. Avoid being killed and try to root the imposter out in order to win. If you’re the imposter, your mission is to kill everyone on board without getting caught. Each time a player is found dead or a player reports something suspicious, you are taken to a voting sequence where everyone discusses who they think is “sus” (that’d be suspicious) and then proceeds to kick someone out. \n\nWhile current circumstances have made the game really pop off in recent months, the game itself warrants some praise for being extremely addictive. \n\nAfter downloading the game for myself, I played a good hour of it without looking up from my phone, then played throughout the day during work breaks and sneakily during Zoom meetings (though, to be fair, there are worse things I could’ve been doing.) The game forces you to utilize those Sherlockian deduction skills and work on your own gaslighting abilities. It’s fast-paced and fun, even if you’re not Discord-level dedicated.\n\nWhile the game’s accessibility (it’s free on most platforms and doesn’t require any extra consoles or gaming systems) and its straightforward, easy gameplay surely factor into its popularity, the pandemic undoubtedly skyrocketed it into a craze.',

        'There are 10 crew members trapped on a spacecraft, carrying out menial tasks to maintain vital systems, but at least one of them is an imposter who wants to sabotage their work and if possible, murder them. What sounds like the premise of a particularly bleak science-fiction movie is in fact the set-up of one of the most popular video games of the year. Developed by a three-person team at InnerSloth and launched to virtual obscurity in 2018, Among Us has suddenly become one of the biggest games on PC and mobile, attracting more than 85m players in the last six months. It’s so successful, InnerSloth recently abandoned plans to work on a sequel, instead piling their resources into the original. No one, it seems, is more surprised about the success of this game than its creators.\n\nSo why has this happened? Among Us is essentially an online multiplayer version of the party game wink murder, but set on a constantly malfunctioning spaceship. Up to 10 players take part, and at the beginning, you’re told whether you’re an innocent crew member or an imposter. While the former carry out jobs such as rebooting the communications systems or cleaning out the air ducts, the latter stalk the corridors breaking vital equipment or looking for victims to kill.\n\nWhen a crew member discovers a body, they call a meeting, at which point all the players are allowed to talk to each other for a limited time. During these discussions, the crew needs to try to work out the identity of the imposter(s) by comparing alibis and reporting on which other players seem to have been acting suspiciously: what was Tim doing so close to the scene of the crime, and why can’t Emma recall what task she was apparently working on? Accusations fly, temporary alliances form and whopping lies are told. Sessions can often descend into anarchic shouting matches, with players frantically justifying their movements around the ship. Then a vote takes place, one player is hurled from the spaceship’s air locker, and the others discover if they’ve just saved themselves from certain death or murdered an innocent workmate.\n\nAs the game continues, the paranoia ramps up. Crew members can use security cameras to spy on others, while imposters can use air ducts to sneak around. Although there are traditional video game objectives to fulfil – the crew members can win the game if they complete all their allotted tasks before everyone is dead – this is essentially a game about acting; or, more accurately, it’s a game about lying to your friends. (You can play against strangers but it’s not as fun and there are a LOT of cheats out there.) The beauty of the game is the way in which it allows players to exploit the personality traits of their peers, tapping in on the neuroses of anxious players to create plausible guilt scenarios, or flattering egotists so that they don’t suspect you.\n\nIn short, this is all the fun of a slightly drunken board game night, but virtual, which makes it perfect for the semi-lockdown situation a lot of us are in right now. Brighter, cuter video games such as Fortnite and Animal Crossing proved popular during the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis, but now, after months of this horror, and with patience fraying, we’re ready for something more cynical and spiteful, something more akin to the end of a game night, where players are seconds from dropkicking the Trivial Pursuit board into next door’s garden.\n\nThere is, you may have spotted, something particularly 2020 about Among Us. Its emphasis on fabrication, on blame-shifting, and on reporting other people to the authorities is extremely on point. As writer Sean Sands points out in his excellent Vice article, “Among Us is rife with ever-cascading crises, and people trapped in a sense of isolation while they try to solve problems for which they are woefully unequipped. Into this crumbling world the game introduces a dash of bad-faith actors whose purpose – as much as open violence – is to sow distrust and distraction.”',

        'If your kid has been calling everything they don’t like “sus” lately, they’re probably playing Among Us. In Among Us slang, “sus” means “suspicious,” a word that sums up the appeal of the multiplayer social deduction game perfectly: It’s all about mistrust, misdirection, and paranoia. But in a fun way.\n\nReleased in 2018 to little acclaim or interest, Among Us suddenly exploded over the last few months. Millions of kids are playing it, watching other kids play it, and memeing about it. Among Us has become so popular that a recent Twitch stream of the game with congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been viewed over 4.5 million times. If AOC’s get-out-the-vote effort actually works, Among Us may help decide the next president.\n\nIf you’re interested, here are some top AOC Among Us moments, compiled for us by the Washington Post; if you’re totally lost, keep reading and we’ll explain everything.\n\nSo, what kind of game is it?\nIf you’ve ever played flesh-and-blood party games Werewolf or Mafia, you’ll be right at home with Among Us. In it, four to ten players take on the roles of menial workers on a spaceship, completing routine tasks to keep everything running smoothly. But one or two of the players are secret impostors, intent on murdering the crew. With a killer/killers stalking them, the crew meets to discuss who might be a traitor, and if enough people pin the same player, he or she is ejected out of the airlock and into space… which is great, unless you pick the wrong person.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are not that important. It’s really a game about interacting with the other players. The impostors try to divert suspicion onto innocent crew members, while the workers are busy trying to “sus” out the killer and keep suspicion off themselves. It’s hilarious and awesome to get together with friends virtually and try to trick them into accusing others of crimes, or try to determine which of your friends is a good enough liar to get away with space-murder.\n\nLike most online games, it’s possible to slip into a session with a bunch of randos, but it’s not terribly fun. You really need to share voice chat and know the people involved to get the most out of Among Us, which is probably why your kid is addicted.\n\nPlay it a few times and you’ll get it. I joined a couple games with my kid and some of his friends and immediately got into the spirit. Turns out, old people like me are really good at deceiving children. Must be all that practice with the whole “Santa” thing.\n\nWhy is it so popular?\nAmong Us jumped to the top of online streaming charts at first because a handful of well-known gamers started playing it publicly, but it “stuck” because it’s the perfect game for social distancing. The barrier for entry is very low — it’s free for mobile and only five bucks on PC — and it doesn’t take a ton of concentration or video game dexterity.\n\nInstead of being about perfect reflexes like a shooter, Among Us is about social interaction. In a time when kids (and grownups) can’t hang out together, it’s a perfect stress reliever and a great way to interact with pals.\n\nIs Among Us here to stay?\nIn spite of its massive popularity, I doubt Among Us will be one of those perennially popular online games like Minecraft or Counter-Strike. According to my 13 year-old, the game is already slipping in popularity from a few weeks ago. I mean, parents know about it now!\n\nAnd, with all due respect to AOC’s attempts to get young people to vote, when politicians start glomming onto a trendy kid thing, it sounds a little like a death knell. So now is the time to check it out.',
